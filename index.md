# Hi, I'm Ali G!
Welcome to my ICS3U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## About me
A short intro (interests, goals, tools I’m learning).
Hey! I'm Ali, I'm 16 and I absolutely love music. I'm also really big on programming and software development and I aspire to be accepted in the Waterloo Computer Science program. I want to learn as much languages and use them for future projects. As of now, I know *Javascript, Java, Lua, a bit of C, HTML and CSS*.
